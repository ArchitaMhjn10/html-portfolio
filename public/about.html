<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hi, I'm Archita — a passionate web developer with a knack for creating clean, responsive, and user-focused websites.
I love turning ideas into intuitive digital experiences that not only look good but also work seamlessly.
</p>

<p>Currently diving deep into frontend and full-stack development, I'm constantly exploring new technologies
 and pushing myself to write better code every day.
 Whether it's building an interactive UI or solving a tricky bug, I enjoy the entire process of creating for the web.
</p>

<p>Outside of code, you'll find me experimenting with design, learning new skills,
 or chasing aesthetic inspiration (sometimes through pixels, sometimes through coffee-fueled late nights).
</p>

<p>I believe great web experiences are built with equal parts logic and creativity — and I'm here to bring both.
</p>
